## This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
## It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
## it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
##
## A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
## Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
##
## For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#stages

## You can copy and paste this template into a new `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
## You should not add this template to an existing `.gitlab-ci.yml` file by using the `include:` keyword.
